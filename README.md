# Shell-Hacks-2021
This is my submission for the Shell Hack 2021 competition. I wanted to build a calculator that estimates how well your heart is doing and what the chance of dying of heart related diseases is. I did not the application so the calculator isn't working. My group broke up yesterday afternoon so I was forced to start something from scratch. Initially I wanted to host the application on a server but I couldn't. Then I settled for doing a GUI but I ran out of time. But if you want to take a look at the Data analysis then just look into the notebook. The future plans for this "calculator" is to enable people to quickly assess their heart condition based a bunch of factors. I wish there was more data readily available then the factors included could be more comprehensive and more accurate since only 300 data entries were taken.
